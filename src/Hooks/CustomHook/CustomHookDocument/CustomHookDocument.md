- Custom Hook:
    - About Custom Hook:
        - If we want to use a functionality in multiple components, we can create a custom hook.
        - It allows us to encapsulate logic and share it across multiple components (In entire application).
        - Custom hooks are just like Java Script functions that start with the word "use" and can call other hooks if needed.

    - Use Cases:
        - Custom Hooks enable us to extract and share specific pieces of logic (example: Fetching data, handling form state, etc.) across multiple components (In entire application).
        - Instead of repeating the same code in multiple components, we can create a custom hook that encapsulates that logic and reuse it by centralizing the logic in a single place.
